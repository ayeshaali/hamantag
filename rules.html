	<h1>Official Rules</h1>
	<ol class = "rules-outer">

	<li>Targets<ol class = "rules-inner">
		<li>Each player has one unique Target and is simultaneously the Target of another player.</li>
		<li>All players are assigned Targets randomly. If you forget your target, please see either Andrew Cramer or Jordan Woods.</li>
		<li>Each player will never be the Target of more than one player and no player will ever have more than one Target.</li>
		<li>A Hunter could be assigned to anyone from the student body or a handful of volunteer teachers.</li>
	</ol></li>

	<li>Tags<ol class = "rules-inner">
		<li>Each player’s objective is to tag his or her Target with one sticker. Only stickers provided by the Senate may be used in the game. A successful tag will result in the Target’s elimination.</li>
		<li>A tag requires the Hunter’s placement of a sticker onto the body or clothing of the Target without being noticed. If that procedure is not followed, the tag is invalidated, and the Hunter may not make another attempt until 8:15 AM the following day.</li>
		<li>If the Target notices the impending tag and makes a motion or vocal response during or prior to the sticker being placed down then the tag is ruled invalid (all tags must be stealthy).</li>
		<li>If the tag is valid under the rules of II.a, II.b, and II.c, then the Target is permanently eliminated from the game. The tagged Target must then reveal his or her Target, who then becomes the Hunter’s next Target.</li>
		<li>There is no limit on the number of successful tags that can be made by a Hunter in one day.</li>
		<li>It is responsibility of each player to inform Andrew Cramer or Jordan Woods about any and all successful tags or to input that information into <a href="https://www.trinitystickertag.com">trinitystickertag.com</a>.</li>
		<li>Tags are valid only from the beginning of first period until the official end of school (3:30 or 2:30) and must be executed within the walls of Trinity School. This rule may be amended as the game progresses.</li>
		<li>A Hunter cannot tag during class, in the math lab, in a teacher's office, during community time or chapel, or before first period. The punishment for infraction is automatic disqualification from the game</li>
		<li>Disputes between two players with regard to the legitimacy of a tag will be decided by Andrew Cramer or Jordan Woods.</li>
	</ol></li>

	<li>Disputed Tags<ol class = "rules-inner">
		<li>A disputed tag will be reviewed on a case by case basis. Simply approach either game-maker in the hallways to resolve a dispute. Both parties must be present. This review will adjudicate conflicts arising between players and review accusations of cheating. Otherwise, you can enter your dispute into <a href="https://www.trinitystickertag.com">trinitystickertag.com</a> for a quicker judgment, but also one that will likely be less exact.</li>
		<li>The Senate can change the Target of a player at any point in the game. All players will be promptly notified of any changes regarding their Target. The Senate may also disqualify players.</li>
	</ol></li>

	<li>Teachers and Classes<ol class = "rules-inner">
		<li>All teachers can disqualify a player if he or she interferes with a teacher or class in any way.</li>
		<li>Any students leaving a class, practice, or performance, early, arriving late, or stepping out to participate in Sticker Tag will be eliminated. It is the responsibility of the eliminated player to notify Deen Amanat or Milan Jain or input their disqualification into <a href="https://www.trinitystickertag.com">trinitystickertag.com</a></li>
	</ol></li>

	<li>Further Rules<ol class = "rules-inner">
		<li>During the course of the game, the Senate maintains the right to amend any rule (except those stipulated in section IV).</li>
		<li>The 24-hour rule (II.B) on tags will no longer apply once fewer than 50 competitors remain.</li>
		<li>When only 15 players remain in the game, the 8:15am to 3:30pm rule (II.G) will be suspended – players may execute tags at any time of the day.</li>
		<li>Any attempt to disrupt or cheat at Sticker Tag, especially by means of hacking or abusing <a href="https://www.trinitystickertag.com">trinitystickertag.com</a>, will result in punitive action, including but not limited to immediate removal from the Sticker Tag game.</li>
	</ol></li>
